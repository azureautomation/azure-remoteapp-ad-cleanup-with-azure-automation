Azure RemoteApp AD Clean-up with Azure Automation
=================================================

            

This wokflow can be used to cleanup your Active Directory when using Azure RemoteApp in a hybrid deployment. This workflow is orginally created for using it in Azure Automation. This workflow triggers another Azure Automation PowerShell script which
 can be found here: [https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Azure-RemoteApp-AD-Cleanup-527f9d27](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Azure-RemoteApp-AD-Cleanup-527f9d27). This script is a PowerShell script which also can be used in other scenarios.

TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
